                    <h2>What It Is</h2>

                    <p>Next Up is a full-featured podcast alarm clock, allowing you to be woken up by any podcast you've downloaded in the Apple Podcasts app. It provides a more pleasant, more engaging, and more customizable option than alarm sounds, music, or live radio. Wake up to a meditation, the news, a comedy show, or the voice of LeVar Burton reading you a new short story.</p>

                    <p><strong>Next up is now live in the App Store, and can be found</strong> <a class="strong-link"
                            href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/next-up-a-podcast-alarm/id1472608295?ls=1" class="name">here.</a>
                    </p>


                    <h2>What It Does</h2>
                    <p>Next Up integrates with podcasts already managed in the native Podcasts app and starts playing them in the native Music app when the alarm is triggered. </p>

                    <p>Tailor each alarm to its podcast. Schedule alarms to repeat on the days a new episode is released. Play the newest episodes first for news, sports, and current events, or start with the oldest to catch up on serial or stand-alone podcasts.</p>

                    <p>Lower the volume for louder podcasts, or keep it high for the quiet ones. Fade-in the volume gradually for a gentler wake-up, or for podcasts with especially long or loud intros.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Where It Came From</h2>
                    
                    <p>A few months ago I decided that I wanted to wake up to something less abrasive than alarm sounds and more engaging
                        than music. I considered the radio, but didn't want to be stuck with one station or show.</p>
                    
                    <p>So I scoured the web and the App Store looking for an app that would do one simple
                        thing: allow me to wake up in the morning to a podcast of my choosing. I wasn't satisfied with what I found, so I
                        figured I'd try to make it myself.</p>
                    
                    

                    <h2>What's New</h2>
                    <p>Version 1.0.1 currently pending approval. Expedites and clarifies app introduction and instructions.</p>

                    <p>After I work out any bugs and other issues following the initial release, I have a lot more ideas for
                        what else I
                        might like to add when I have the time â€“ from sleep timers to white noise, to custom themes and more.
                        I've got some
                        other stuff going on right at the moment, though, so probably don't hold your breath.</p>
