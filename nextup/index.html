                    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                    <p>A few months ago I decided that I wanted to wake up to something less abrasive than alarm sounds and more engaging
                        than music. I considered the radio, but didn't want to be stuck with one station or show.</p>

                    <p>So I scoured the web and the App Store looking for an app that would do one simple
                        thing: allow me to wake up in the morning to a podcast of my choosing. I wasn't satisfied with what I found, so I figured I'd try to make it myself.</p>

                    <h3>Functionality</h3>
                    <p>I designed Next Up with the intention of creating something clean, intuitive, and well-suited to
                        its particular purpose. It integrates with podcasts already managed in the native Podcasts app
                        and plays in the native Music app. </p>

                    <p>Each alarm has options to repeat on particular days of the week, play the newest episodes first,
                        only play uneard episodes, choose snooze duration, max volume and fade-in duration, and more.
                        This allows it to accomodate for podcasts of all different types, whether daily, weekly, serial,
                        stand-alone, or those dealing with news or current events.</p>


                    <h3>Ads and Privacy</h3>
                    <p>Next Up will never use intrusive banner or pop-up adds of any kind. There are just too many of those in the world already. Nor will it ever collect or sell anyone's personal data. That's just not an ok thing to do.</p>

                    <h3>Support</h3>
                    <p>Next Up is the pet project of a lone developer. I'll do my best to respond to questions, comments, and bug fix requests as soon as I'm able, but patience is always appreciated. </p>

                    <p>For questions and bug reports, send me an email at <a href="mailto:next_up_support@landonjmitchell.com">next_up_support@landonjmitchell.com</a></p>


                    <h3>Next Up</h3>
                    <p>After I work out any bugs and other issues following the initial release, I have a lot more ideas for what else I might like to add when I have the time â€“ from sleep timers to white noise, to custom themes and more. </p>
