                    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                    
                    <p>A few months ago I decided that I wanted to wake up to something less abrasive than alarm sounds and more engaging
                        than music. I considered the radio, but didn't want to be stuck with one station or show.</p>
                    
                    <p>So I scoured the web and the App Store looking for an app that would do one simple
                        thing: allow me to wake up in the morning to a podcast of my choosing. I wasn't satisfied with what I found, so I
                        figured I'd try to make it myself.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Functionality</h2>
                    <p>Next Up was designed to be a clean, intuitive tool, well-suited to
                        its particular purpose. It integrates with podcasts already managed in the native Podcasts app
                        and plays in the native Music app. </p>
                    
                    <p>Each alarm has options to repeat on particular days of the week, play the newest episodes first,
                        only play uneard episodes, choose snooze duration, max volume and fade-in duration, and more.
                        This allows it to accomodate for podcasts of all different types, whether daily, weekly, serial,
                        stand-alone, or those dealing with news or current events.
                    </p>

                    <h2>In The App Store</h2>

                    <p>After I work out any bugs and other issues following the initial release, I have a lot more ideas for what else I
                        might like to add when I have the time â€“ from sleep timers to white noise, to custom themes and more. I've got some
                        other stuff going on right at the moment, though, so probably don't hold your breath.</p>
