                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Long before I ever considered taking a course in iOS app development, I knew, if I took one, what my final project
                    would be. I wanted to wake up to something less abrasive than alarm sounds and more engaging than music. </p>
                    
                    <p>I spent hours and hours over the course of months looking for an app that would do one simple thing: allow me to wake up in the morning to a podcast of my choosing. The options I found were few and disappointing.</p>

                    <h3>Functionality</h3>
                    <p>I designed Next Up with the intention of creating something clean, intuitive, and well-suited to its particular purpose. It integrates with podcasts already managed in the native Podcast app and plays in the native Music app. </p>
                        
                    <p>Each alarm has options to repeat on particular days of the week, play the newest episodes first, only play uneard episodes, and enable or disable snooze. This allows it to accomodate for podcasts of all different types, whether daily, weekly, serial, stand-alone, or those dealing with news or current events..</p>

        
                    <h3>Next Up</h3>
                    <p>Next Up is very, very close being ready for App Store submission. At the moment I'm testing and retesting the corner cases, polishing some blemishes, and fleshing out some quick introductory instructions. After the initial release, I have a lot more ideas for what's next, from sleep timers to recommendations, to custom themes and more. </p>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Over the summer I developed a graphical interface for visualizing and manipulating plot slices for the open-source Monte Carlo particle transport simulation software, OpenMC. It was voluntary contribution overseen by a former Python instructor, the project's originator, Dr. Paul Romano. </p>
                        
                    <p>With the bulk of the form and functionality completed, the project was passed on for final completion and integration when I returned to a full time schedule.</p>

                    <h3>Technologies</h3>
                    <p>The program was implemented in Python, using a Python adaptation of the Qt graphical framework called Pyside2, and dependent on integration with the OpenMC code base.  </p>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>REGGIE is a complete, real-world school registration system specification. As the final project for an Object Oriented Programming course, I was tasked with implementing a subtantial portion of the specifications, and received very positive feedback on the result.</p>
                    
                    <p>Features included log-ins, courses, sections, schedules, student transcripts, instructor assignments, rosters, prerequisites, user and administrative user-management, student registration with multiple eligibility requirements, instructor approval requests, and grade assignment, among others.</p>

                    <h3>Technologies</h3>
                    <p>The program was written in Python, with an emphasis on good use of OOP design patterns. The program used a text-based terminal interface. </p>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>As a personal project, and chance to put into practice some of what I learned in my studies of web development, I decided to put together this website as a simple showcase of some of my education and experience in less formal format than a <a href="resources/Landon Mitchell Resume.pdf">resume</a> or <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/landonjmitchell">LinkedIn</a> profile. </p>
        
                    <p>It's an ongoing project, with more planned than has already been implemented.</p>
        
                    <h3>Technologies</h3>
                    <p>At the moment I am exploring all that can be done with HTML and CSS alone (with a smattering of Bootstrap), though I do plan to implement JavaScript functionality as the project continues.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>As my role as a Project Coordinator for the Haitian disaster response project neared conclusion, I prepared and oversaw a survey of the beneficiaries of the debris management programs, which included the demolition of unsafe structures and removal of rubble from personal properties.  </p>

                    <p>I used the information from this survey, and from the database of benefiary and worksite information that I had previously overhauled, to compile an exhaustive, data-rich final analysis of the programs' impact in the community we were trying to serve.</p>

                    <p>Not every out outcome was what we hoped, but it was important to honestly asses what had been done to provide guidance for future projects. To that end, I also wrote a document of guidelines and advice for futre debris management projects. </p>
