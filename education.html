                    <p>As an undergrad I took an intro to CS class. We programmed a little robot to explore its environment, stay within
                        colored boundaries, and follow a path to a colored target on the floor. My professor encouraged me to major in CS.
                        It was too late for undergrad, but I never gave up on the idea.
                    </p>

                    <p>Even before then, I always had an interest. I tinkered with online Python courses. I taught myself the essentials of
                        HTML and CSS just for fun. As a kid I used my Christmas money to buy our family's first 56k modem.</p>

                    <p>When the opportunity came, I took it. I moved to Chicago, took the GRE, applied, and enrolled. It's definitely been challenging at times, but I've worked hard, and I'm proud of the successes I've had. </p>

                    <h5>GPA: 3.72</h5>

                    <p>As a recipient of the National Merit Award, I was offered a full-tuition scholarship by the school, as well as a place in the school's AJ Gordon Scholars program. Mostly I looked forward to participating in the school's full-year study abroad program at the University of Oxford.
                    </p>

                    <p>I entered college as a philosophy major. After a little time I fell in love with linguistics, and hoped to work with the school to carve out a path towards a degree in it, despite it not being officially offered. I even worked out a special arrangement to have an individual tutorial with the school's linguistics professor. I hoped to spend my year abroad in Oxford accumulating the necessary credits</p>

                    <p>In the end the logistics of it didn't work out. I studied Greek and Hebrew, and participated in an elective summer tour of Israel and Jordan as a part of special historical geography program. I used the credits earned through these to graduate with a degree in Biblical and Theological studies, with a concentration in Biblical languages.</p>

                    <p>I spent my Junior year at the University of Oxford as a part of a study-abroad progam. While there I had individual tutorials with university professors on topics including linguistics, discourse analysis, philosophy of language, and literary criticism.</p>

                    <h3>Jerusalem University College</h3>
                    <p>The summer before Junior year I participated in an intensive summer semster program hosted by Jerusalem University College. We toured ancient sites all over Israel and Jordan, with an emphasis on history and geography of the region, and how they were interrelated.</p>

                    <p>Back then, as now, I liked languages. I took four years of French and a year of Spanish. Senior year I took a few philosophy classes at the local community college.
                    </p>

                    <p>Even in middle school I had already been studying classical Latin and Greek. Math was also a favorite subject.</p>
